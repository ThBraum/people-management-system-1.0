# People management system in REST API with Spring Boot 1.0

***
I created this project during my immersion in one of the digital innovation one bootcamps. It is a REST API with Spring Boot for registering and managing people in an organization.
***
We may store information such as:
 - First name;
 - Last name;
 - CPF;
 - Birth date; 
 - Phone number
 
 Then, with the help of a db, we can list the information for visualization and control as we like.

 ###### Just a basic example with little information, but you can store a lot more information.

 ##### note1: If you want to initialize the code via terminal - or even make it easier to run - you can also create a Fat JAR. After that all you need to do is go into the ` target ` folder using some terminal and type ` java -jar personapi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar `. This command will initialize ` http://localhost:8080/people `. To enter ur data you can use some tool like [Postman](https://web.postman.co).
 
 ##### note2: This is version 1.0 - my first try in another words -, a version 2.0 with improvements may be coming soon. I'm studying for this :smile:
